# Project: 
### Doc folder

The doc directory contains the report or presentation files. It can have subfolders.  

[Project description] (doc/Proj1_desc.md)

[Project Main R File]Â (doc/Main.Rmd)

Note that the Main.html file is only an extract for you to be able to see the results without running the Rmd file. However, all graphs won't show up because my notebook contains two shiny applications which need to be run in R.
