# Project: 
### Code lib Folder

The lib directory contains various files with function definitions (but only function definitions - no code that actually runs).

For this project, the folder contains only two files with different types of functions:
+ displaying.R: contains visualization functions
+ processing.R: contains functions used during data processing steps
