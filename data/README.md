# Project: 
### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

Data provided for this project:
+ InauguralSpeeches: folder containing all US inaugural speeches since Washington in 1789
+ InaugurationDates.txt: contains the dates of the inaugural speeches
+ InaugurationInfo.xlsx: contains additional information about the speeches (party, number of words)
