### Project Description:
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester.

Term: Spring 2017

+ Project title: US Inaugural Speeches - Focus on presidents having done two terms in office"
+ Project subtitle: What is the mindset of a reelected president? Is there any trend or pattern that can be identified among reelected presidents?
+ This project is conducted by Marie Schiltz
+ Project summary: Sixteen US presidents did two terms in office which represents almost 150 years. My study aims to compare their first and their second inaugural speeches to identify trends and patterns. I would like to determine the mindset of a president beginning his second term in office (by comparison with the first term). Is the president more confident during the second inaugural speech? Is he more optimistic or more realistic? Overall my study shows that presidents are more pessimistic during their second inaugural speech (or at least show less enthusiasm), the trust lexicon takes less place while the fear lexicon is more present.
