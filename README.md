### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester.

Term: Spring 2017

+ Project title: US Inaugural Speeches - Focus on presidents having done two terms in office"
+ Project subtitle: What is the mindset of a reelected president? Is there any trend or pattern that can be identified among reelected presidents?
+ This project is conducted by Marie Schiltz
+ Project summary: Sixteen US presidents did two terms in office which represents almost 150 years. My study aims to compare their first and their second inaugural speeches to identify trends and patterns. I would like to determine the mindeset of a president beginning his second term in office (by comparison with the first term).
